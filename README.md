## ðŸ“Œ Description
**Operating Systems Projects 2025**  

This repository contains all the work developed during the **Operating Systems** course.  
It covers fundamental OS topics such as **processes, threads, scheduling, concurrency, memory management, file systems, and synchronization**, implemented in C/C++ and tested in a Linux environment.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Assignments**: Small tasks focused on specific OS concepts.  
- **Labs**: Hands-on experiments (Linux tools, processes, threads, semaphores, signals, memory management, file systems).  
- **Projects**: Larger implementations such as schedulers, virtual memory, and concurrency mechanisms.  
- **Documentation**: Notes, reports, and additional resources.  

## ðŸ›  Technical Highlights
- **C / C++** programming.  
- **Linux environment** with GCC/G++.  
- **nano** text editor.  
- **Makefiles** for compilation.  
- Emphasis on **synchronization, memory, scheduling, concurrency, and file systems**.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repository demonstrates the practical application of **Operating Systems theory** through hands-on development.  
It serves both as an academic record and as part of a professional portfolio for systems programming.
